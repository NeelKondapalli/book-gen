The dehumanization of characters in "The Metamorphosis" by Franz Kafka and "Night" by Elie Wiesel serves as a profound exploration of the darker aspects of human nature. Both texts depict individuals subjected to dehumanization, either through physical transformation or systemic oppression, highlighting the loss of humanity and the consequences thereof.

In Kafka's "The Metamorphosis," Gregor Samsa undergoes a harrowing transformation from a loving husband and father into a monstrous bug. His family's initial empathy quickly turns to disdain, as they view him not as a man but as a verminous pestilence. The father's anger and the mother's indifference reflect a chilling shift in perspective, reducing Gregor to an object of repulsion rather than a member of the family. This dehumanization is further exemplified by the father's contemplation of throwing Gregor out of the window, treating him as a burden rather than a beloved son [1]. The once compassionate father now sees Gregor as something to be rid of, emphasizing the loss of the essence that defined his humanity.

In Wiesel's "Night," the Jews are subjected to a different yet equally devastating form of dehumanization. Deportation to concentration camps, forced labor, and starvation strip them of their identity and dignity. The vermin-like conditions in which they live, such as overcrowded barracks and unsanitary living quarters, mirror the treatment of Gregor but on a grander, systemic scale [7]. The loss of personal autonomy and the violation of basic human rights transform the once vibrant Jewish community into a group of nameless, faceless victims. The infamous scene where a child is taken from his mother's arms by the SS further underscores the brutal efficiency with which dehumanization is carried out.

The comparison between Gregor's transformation and the Jews' suffering reveals a shared thematic thread: the loss of humanity through dehumanization. For Gregor, it begins with physical mutation and ends in emotional abandonment [2]. For the Jews, it starts with systematic persecution and culminates in the annihilation of their community and culture [8]. Both experiences detail how individuals can be stripped of their humanity, reduced to mere objects or vermin to be exterminated. The contrast between these two scenarios highlights the universality of dehumanization as a tool of oppression.

Gregor's family and the Nazi regime both engage in acts that deny the humanity of those they encounter. Gregor's parents, though initially filled with compassion, abandon him entirely after his transformation [3]. Similarly, the Nazis dehumanize the Jews through forced labor and starvation, erasing their identities and reducing them to numbers in a system designed for extermination [9]. This shared dynamic underscores the ease with which humanity can be discarded when it no longer serves a purpose.

Ultimately, both texts convey the profound consequences of dehumanizationâ€”loss of identity, suffering, and the erasure of human dignity. Gregor's story, though one of personal tragedy, serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of viewing individuals as vermin or burdens to be eliminated. Similarly, "Night" offers a stark reminder of the Holocaust's atrocities, where entire communities were reduced to mere vermin in the eyes of their oppressors [10]. Both narratives underscore the importance of recognizing and resisting dehumanization, as it is a step towards enabling violence and oppression.

In conclusion, the dehumanization explored in "The Metamorphosis" and "Night" serves as a stark reminder of humanity's capacity for cruelty and the potential for systemic annihilation. By understanding these stories, we can better appreciate the value of human dignity and the need to safeguard it against those who seek to diminish it.
